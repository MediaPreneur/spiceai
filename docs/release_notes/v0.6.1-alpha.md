# Spice.ai v0.6.1-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.6.1-alpha!

This minor release builds upon v0.6-alpha adding flight connector and arrow processor.

## Highlights in v0.6.1-alpha

### New Flight connector and arrow processor

You can now use a Flight connector to pull data from an [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) endpoint. You can write your queries in a separate SQL file and inform its path in the manifest. Flight connectors are very efficient and avoid internal copy of data with the arrow processor.

Example in a manifest:

```yaml
dataspaces:
  - from: project
    name: flight-data
    data:
      connector:
        name: flight
        params:
          url: flight.spiceai.io:443
          password: my_api_key
          sql: path/to/query.sql
      processor:
        name: arrow
```

## New in this release

- **Adds** a start training button on the dashboard pod page.
- **Adds** TensorBoard logging and monitoring when using DQL and SACD learning algorithms.
  
### Dependency updates
